\section{Conclusion}
The main contribution of this paper is a doubly robust estimator of $\mathcal{S}$-specific value functions. Doubly robust offline estimation of $\mathcal{S}$-specific value function can help us better understand how and where a policy will perform before investing time and money in online evaluation. These methods are also essential in assessing the fairness of policies.
